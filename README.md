# üîç Feature Detection & Matching in Images (SIFT, ORB, RANSAC)

This project demonstrates how to detect and match keypoints between two images using popular computer vision algorithms ‚Äî SIFT, ORB (alternative to SURF), and RANSAC for outlier rejection and transformation estimation.

| File Name           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `SHIFT_TA2_65.ipynb`  | Keypoint detection and matching using SIFT. |
| `SURF_TA2_65.ipynb`   | Robust feature detection using ORB (free alternative to SURF). |
| `RANSAC_TA2_65.ipynb` | Uses RANSAC to filter keypoint matches and estimate a homography matrix. |

## üì∏ Sample Images

Use sample images from OpenCV like:
- [`box.png`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/data/box.png)
- [`box_in_scene.png`](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/data/box_in_scene.png)

Or split a single side-by-side photo into two halves.

## üß† Algorithms Used

### 1. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- Detects keypoints that are invariant to scale and rotation.
- Matched using BFMatcher with L2 norm.

### 2. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)
- Free alternative to SURF.
- Efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
- Uses Hamming distance for descriptor matching.

### 3. RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)
- Filters out incorrect keypoint matches.
- Estimates a homography matrix between image pairs.
